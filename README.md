* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

KPI's in this domain can be measured and shown through a financial dashboard that include:

Firm metrics: Gross revenue, direct expenses, overhead expenses, gross profit margin, and net/operating profit margin. 

Growth KPI: New amount/percent of revenue from new clients, new amount/percent revenue from existing clients, %age of revenue that's recurring, client retention rate, revenue (or asset) retention rate.

Clients KPI: Average revenue/client, distribution of revenue/client, distribution (and average) or client age, client revenue/hour and profit/client.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Compared to top online brokeridges (in numner of shares) Robinhood has had a significant growth increase Q2 of 2020 compared to TD Ameritrade, E-Trade and Schwab.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would suggest adding education/personal advisor for an additional cost but still cheaper than traditional brokeridge firms. They could actually do an apprenticeship program for students. Another idea is to offer an "onboarding specialist" for those not familar with these services.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This would capture the market share that may not otherwise be interested or too afraid to learn.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

E-Learning tools

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Educate the buyer at any level of their knowledge and process.
